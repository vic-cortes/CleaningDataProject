#Code Book
This code book explains all the variables obtained in the data cleaning as well as the variables involved in the Script. The main file has 2 folders, train and test. The script retreived the two data sets and makes one tidy data set which is saved in the variable ``dat_Total``, another tidy data set is saved in the variable ``new_data`` which contains the average of each variable of the data.

## Variables
The used variables are the following:



"Activity" | "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"|               "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"|               "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" |              "tBodyAcc-std()-X"               
 [5] "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"        |        "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"           |     "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"     |       "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"           
 [9] "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"    |        "tGravityAcc-std()-X"       |      "tGravityAcc-std()-Y"    |         "tGravityAcc-std()-Z"
